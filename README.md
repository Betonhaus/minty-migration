Research into migrating a Ubuntu based Linux Mint install to a Debian based one

This is an attempt to determine the steps neccessary to migrate a Ubuntu based Linux Mint installation to a Debian based one, without performing a clean install. Generally it is likely required that the Debian version have the same or newer packages, so the migration can only be done from Linux Mint 21.x to LMDE6 or Linux Mint 22 to LMDE7.
